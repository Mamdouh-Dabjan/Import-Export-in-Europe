The steps taken to complete this project:
1- I downloaded the dataset and uploaded it to mysql.
2- I cleaned the data and made sure nothing is missing.
3- I exported the data into Tablaeu.
4- I created a dashboard and posted it on Tablaeu public.
The file uploaded contains the whole data set as well as the final dashboard.
You can also check it out on Tablaeu public at https://tabsoft.co/3wzVChg
