# Import-Export-around-the-world
I have analyzed a dataset that contains information about the Import/Export situation of the world's countries  
The link to the original dataset: https://bit.ly/3q9hAnX  
The steps taken to complete this project:   
1- I downloaded the dataset and uploaded it to MySQL.   
2- I cleaned the data and made sure nothing is missing.   
3- I exported the data into Tableau.   
4- I created a dashboard and posted it on Tableau public.   
The file uploaded contains the whole data set as well as the final dashboard.   
You can also check it out on Tableau public at https://tabsoft.co/3wzVChg
